LinkML-Scala is a robust, cross-platform library (JVM, Scala.JS, Scala Native) powered by Scala 3.8+.

Prerequisite Note: LinkML-Scala requires JDK 17 or higher. It will not run on older Java versions.

While primarily a library, you can access its core features (like schema validation and code generation) 
directly from your terminal using the `linkml-scala` Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Installation

Choose the installation method that best fits your operating system and workflow. Once installed, running `linkml-scala`
without any options will print a helpful list of available commands.

### Method 1: The Install Script (Recommended for Unix/macOS)

If you are on Linux (x86_64, ARM64), macOS (ARM64), or using WSL on Windows, the easiest way to grab the latest release 
is via our installation script:

```shell
. <(curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeverBlink-OSS/linkml-scala/refs/heads/main/cli/install.sh)
linkml-scala
```

### Method 2: Using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) (Cross-Platform)

You can install `linkml-scala` on any platform (including Windows) using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html)
environment manager:

```shell
mise use 'github:NeverBlink-OSS/linkml-scala'
linkml-scala
```

Or install a specific version (useful if a new release is within mise's 7-day registry caching window)
```shell
mise use 'github:NeverBlink-OSS/linkml-scala@v0.8.6'
linkml-scala
```

### Method 3: Manual Download

If you prefer a manual setup, head over to the Releases Page and download the pre-compiled binary for your specific OS 
and architecture.

*For macOS and Linux:*
Rename the downloaded file, make it executable, and run it:

```shell
mv linkml-scala-<os>-<arch> linkml-scala
./linkml-scala
```

*For Windows:*
Simply rename the downloaded executable, and run it:

```shell
ren linkml-scala-windows-x86_64.exe linkml-scala.exe
linkml-scala.exe
```

### CLI Usage Guide

#### LinkML schema validation

The `validate` command inspects your LinkML schema for structural and logical issues:

```shell
./linkml-scala validate <input-file>
```

The CLI outputs issues directly to your terminal, categorized into three severity levels:
- Fatal: critical blockers (unknown references, invalid range types, used undefined default range)
- Errors: structural violations (multiple keys or ID slots, multiple tree roots, ID collisions)
- Warnings: non-critical issues (invalid slot usage, undefined default range, missing tree root)

Fatal issues are critical for generation. 
The process will report these and exit immediately, as generation cannot proceed.

#### JSON Schema generation

Generate a standard JSON Schema from your model:

```shell
./linkml-scala generate json-schema <input-file>
```

#### Generation of Scala classes

Generate Scala data structures from your model:
```shell
./linkml-scala generate scala --package <scala-package> --to <output-path> <input-file>
```
Parameters:
- `<scala-package>` - package name for generated classes, _default value: eu.neverblink.linkml.metamodel_
- `<output-path>` - destination file or directory, _if not specified, output will be written to stdout_

#### Generation of SHACL shapes

Generate SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) graphs for RDF validation:
```shell
./linkml-scala generate shacl --to <output-path> <input-file>
```
Parameters:
- `<output-path>` - destination file or directory, _if not specified, output will be written to stdout_

#### Generation of RDF schema

Generate RDF schema:
```shell
./linkml-scala generate rdfs --to <output-path> <input-file>
```
Parameters:
- `<output-path>` - destination file or directory, _if not specified, output will be written to stdout_

#### LinkML schema derivation and pruning 

Generate a LinkML model that:
- Has all imports resolved
- Has all class slots materialized into attributes (opt out by passing `--skip-derivation`)
- Has all unused elements removed (controlled by `--pruning-mode`)

```shell
./linkml-scala generate linkml --to <output-path> <input-file>
```

## Playground

Try LinkML-Scala live in your browser at [neverblink-oss.github.io/linkml-scala/playground](https://neverblink-oss.github.io/linkml-scala/playground), or run it locally with `./mill ui`.

## Contributing

LinkML-Scala uses [mill](https://mill-build.org/) as the build tool. A bootstrap script is included with this repo (`./mill`), so no additional setup is required for CLI usage. In IntelliJ, [you have to import the project as BSP](https://mill-build.org/mill/cli/installation-ide.html#_intellij) and you are good to go.

Common tasks with mill:

- Run CLI directly: `./mill cli.jvm.run --help`
- Start simple the browser UI: `./mill ui`
- Scan the mill project structure: `./mill resolve _`
- Compile all modules: `./mill __.compile`
- Run all tests: `./mill __.test` (prefer specific test running for faster feedback, like `./mill generator.jvm.test`)
- Lint the project `./mill lint` (scalafix + scalafmt)
- Re-generate the metamodel classes `./mill metamodel.regenerate`
- Fetch the metamodel definitions from [linkml/linkml-model](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-model) `./mill metamodel.definitions`
- Publish artifacts locally: `./mill __.publishLocal`
- Assembly runnable .jar: `./mill cli.jvm.assembly`
- Build native binary: `./mill cli.jvm.nativeImage` (requires Coursier (cs) to be installed)
