# Sets up a two-pane tmux "race" session for the generate-shacl comparison GIF:
#   left pane  = native linkml-scala
#   right pane = python linkml (Python 3.14)
#
# Each pane gets the timed command *pre-typed but not run*. race-go.sh then
# presses Enter in both panes back-to-back, so they start together.
#
# Run from the directory that holds the schema; both `linkml-scala` and `linkml`
# must be on PATH. Used by generate-comparison.sh.
#
# IMPORTANT: this must be *sourced* (not run as `bash race-setup.sh`). A detached
# tmux server started by a short-lived subprocess gets reaped when that process
# exits; sourcing keeps it owned by the long-lived (VHS) shell.
